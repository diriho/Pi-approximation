Pie approximulation using the Monte Carlo Simulation

This python program approximate pi - ùõë depending on the number of dots entered. The more dots entered, the better the approximation is.
This repo has two different version, where the first version only focus to visualizing the Monte Carlo simulation using a square and a circle, while the second version deals basically with visualizing how closer we get to the actual value of pi as we increase the number of trials that we do.
