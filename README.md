Pi approximulation using the Monte Carlo Simulation🥧🥧

This python program approximate pi - 𝛑 depending on the number of dots entered. The more dots entered, the better the approximation is.
This repo has two different version, where the first version only focus to visualizing the Monte Carlo simulation using a square and a circle, while the second version deals basically with visualizing how closer we get to the actual value of pi as we increase the number of trials that we do. Feel free to try out different num_trials and see the magic happen :)
